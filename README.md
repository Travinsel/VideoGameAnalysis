# VideoGameAnalysis
Looking through my old stuff I found old PSP, PS3, and Wii games. Going through a nostalgic trip, I realized that my interest in games have changed drastically. Still interested in video games now I wanted to see how gaming has changed overtime. At the end of this analysis my main question I wanted to answer is if I created a game, what type of game would I produce?
Side Note: I had issues importing the original Kaggle file into MySQL, so I converted it into a JSON file.
